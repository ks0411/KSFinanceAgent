# KSFinanceAgent Swimlane Diagram

This swimlane shows the Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot request path. It highlights the immediate acknowledgement, durable background processing, hosted-agent routing, delegated tool execution, and proactive delivery.

## Direct Responses API Turn

Direct clients bypass the channel and Durable Task. They call the same Foundry hosted agent, which still validates the forwarded user assertion, derives isolated state, routes one tool, and uses delegated downstream access.

Tool answers go directly to the client without another model generation step. Only content-free
function-result markers enter the model's conversation history, keeping subsequent calls valid
without retaining permissioned finance responses.

Channel acknowledgement, progress and final answers use ordinary messages, not in-place
streaming. Delivered records suppress later retries, but a crash between sending and persisting
delivery can still duplicate an external message. Clarification cards are ordinary final
messages for their turn; a selection starts a new authenticated turn.

```

The final SQL path is entered only after **all** required terms are resolved. If one field
still needs clarification, return another prompt rather than running the statement. Direct
Responses clients receive readable numbered options; negotiated channel clients receive the
typed envelope, and the Channel Service builds the Adaptive Card from its structured options.
Numbered result text remains available. Publication and retrieval never replace delegated
financial authorization. The release binding includes catalogue version, Search index,
embedding deployment and embedding dimensions; changing any field invalidates an old choice.
