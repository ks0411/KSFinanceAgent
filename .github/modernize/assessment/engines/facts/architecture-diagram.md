# Architecture Diagram

KSFinanceAgent separates channel delivery from finance-agent execution. The channel provides the Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot entry point, while a Foundry hosted agent provides reusable routing, identity isolation, and delegated access to finance systems.

### Data Storage & External Services

The channel uses private Blob Storage for pending turns, proactive conversation references, and idempotency records required by Durable Task. The hosted agent keeps routing history and downstream conversation handles in the platform-managed Foundry State Store under a key derived from validated tenant, user, and conversation identity. Finance data is read from Fabric through delegated SQL or a stateless MCP data-agent call, while KPI definitions come from a stateful Copilot Studio conversation. Microsoft Entra ID supplies signing metadata and On-Behalf-Of tokens; user assertions and access tokens are not stored in orchestration state.

### Key Architectural Decisions

- The channel and hosted agent are separate hosts so the same finance agent can serve Teams, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and direct Responses API callers.
- The channel acknowledges quickly and completes work through Durable Task because downstream calls can exceed the Bot Service timeout.
- Identity is fail-closed: the hosted agent validates the forwarded assertion before deriving a per-user session key or requesting delegated tokens.
- Native function calls are executed by the host. Tool answers are returned verbatim and never fed back to the model; history records content-free result markers instead.
- `get_statement` resolves terminology locally; Search retrieves candidates but never supplies SQL or financial figures.
- Fabric is authoritative for metadata and fact visibility. Search MI access does not inherit user SQL security; revalidate candidates with delegated SQL before exposing them or model-selecting.
- Branches cover distinct region/department pairs. Ratios are recomputed from components; global scopes and regional branches must not double count.
- Pending clarification is bound to caller, conversation, request and the full release binding (catalogue version, Search index, embedding deployment/dimensions). A stale/reset/forged selection cannot execute a financial query.
- This diagram describes the resolver update. Deployment and live acceptance evidence are recorded separately, not inferred from the diagram.
